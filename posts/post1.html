        <h1> My mom was snooping through my phone… </h1>
        <p> I just left my phone for a few seconds to go to the restroom and then I heard my mom ask and shout “who is [insert my boyfriend’s name]?” This was not the first time this happened to me, but this one was just really out of line. </p>

            This reminds me of my mom. She used to go through my contacts and call every number to see who it was and who I was talking to. I’m paying for my own plan now but my mom doesn’t know because she will definitely get pissed at me. </p>

            Well that would piss me off too. I’m 24 right now and I’m still treated like a child. </p>

            I still don’t understand why parents still do this. It’s just infuriating when your own parents can’t even respect your own privacy. </p>
