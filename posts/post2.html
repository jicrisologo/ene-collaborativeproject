        <h1> Parent here. I’m too scared to let go of my children. </h1>
        <p> I love my kids to the moon and back and I would never let anything bad happen to them. Other parents tell me that I tend to be overprotective of my children, but I believed I was only doing what’s best for them. However, I watched this episode called Arkangel from the Black Mirror series and it made me realize that my being overprotective of them may also have consequences. Seeing my children get mad and leave me is the last thing I want to happen. I saw this forum and I thought if I could ask all of you for tips or insights about this matter. Thank you! </p>

            I totally understand how you feel. It’s hard not to jump in and protect our little ones from every bump and scrape. But you know what? Kids need some scrapes and bumps to learn and grow. I’ve learned to take a step back and let my kids explore, make mistakes, and figure things out on their own. It’s really tough, but it’s how life should be – not just for us, but for them as well. </p>

            Thank you so much for this! I guess it’s really just hard to see your children growing up and losing control over them as they become more prone to the risks and the challenges in this world. Although, I am willing to make things right for my children. </p>
