        <h1> I’ve never had a real childhood. </h1>
        <p> I’m a college student now but this was the only time when I felt independent. Now that I’m staying at a dorm away from my parents, I have more control of my time and all. <br><br>
        My college friends and I talked about what we used to do as children and hearing their stories made me feel all FOMO. I’ve never been to a party or a hang out with my friends, I’ve never been outside home past 8, heck I’ve never even been allowed to continue playing football or any other sport after I got a very minor injury when I was younger. <br><br>
        I realized how dull my life was, having spent most of my time like a bird in a cage. Now, it feels too late to explore new things. Sometimes I just wish I could go back in time. </p>

            Don’t worry bro! You’re still young and there’s more to life that you can venture. </p>
