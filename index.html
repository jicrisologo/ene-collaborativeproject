        <h1> What is Helicopter Parenting? </h1>
        <p> Helicopter parenting is a parenting style characterized by overprotecting one’s child. It refers to parents who closely monitor and control their child to ensure their wellbeing and shield them from potential dangers. While the excessive involvement is done out of good intentions and concern, this may unintentionally bring consequences. </p> <br>

        <h1> Our message regarding it? </h1>
        <p>Helicopter parenting prevents a child’s ability to develop important life skills and  independence. It also may lead to scenarios where both the parent and the child experience  high levels of stress and anxiety. The continuous pressure to achieve unrealistic expectations can have long-lasting psychological effects. The concept itself threatens a child’s sense of identity, it restricts their ability to consider different paths towards their life goals and develop.</p>
        <p>A reading suggests the importance of finding a balance between providing support while also allowing children the freedom to explore and learn from their own experiences. Conversely, helicopter parenting negatively impacts a child’s social and emotional being as studies show children of helicopter parents tend to experience higher levels of anxiety, lower levels of self-worth, and struggle with decision-making (Blood)</p>
        <p>We believe that striking a balance between support and independence is important for healthy parenting. While it is natural to want the best for our children, excessive control and constant monitoring threatens their development. We encourage parents to have trust in their child’s capabilities, promote self-reliance, and enable space for explorations.</p>

        <h1> Tips for good parenting: </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow your child the freedom to make decisions, take risks, and learn from their experiences. Offer guidance, but also trust in their ability to overcome obstacles.</li>
            <li>Foster open communication by making your child feel at ease to communicate their feelings, opinions, and worries. Talk to them in depth and actively listen to comprehend their viewpoint.</li>
            <li>Set clear, acceptable boundaries that provide a balance between safety and freedom. Give direction while giving room for development and self-expression.</li>
            <li>Encourage your child’s talents and passions to help them develop their self-esteem and resilience. Teach children how to deal with failures, accept failure as a learning experience,and grow resilient in the face of difficulties.</li>
        </ul>
