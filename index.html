        <h1> What is Helicopter Parenting? </h1>
        <p> Helicopter parenting is a parenting style characterized by overprotecting one’s child. It refers to parents who closely monitor and control their child to ensure their wellbeing and shield them from potential dangers. While the excessive involvement is done out of good intentions and concern, this may unintentionally bring consequences. </p> <br>
        <p> We condemn!!! A reading suggests the importance of finding a balance between providing support while also allowing children the freedom to explore and learn from their own experiences. Conversely, helicopter parenting negatively impacts a child’s social and emotional being as studies show children of helicopter parents tend to experience higher levels of anxiety, lower levels of self-worth, and struggle with decision-making (Blood). </p>
