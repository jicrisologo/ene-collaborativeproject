                - Allow your child the freedom to make decisions, take risks, and learn from their experiences. Offer guidance, but also trust in their ability to overcome obstacles.
                <br>
                - Foster open communication by making your child feel at ease to communicate their feelings, opinions, and worries. Talk to them in depth and actively listen to comprehend their viewpoint.
                <br>
                - Set clear, acceptable boundaries that provide a balance between safety and freedom. Give direction while giving room for development and self-expression.
                <br>
                - Encourage your childâ€™s talents and passions to help them develop their self-esteem and resilience. Teach children how to deal with failures, accept failure as a learning experience, and grow resilient in the face of difficulties.
