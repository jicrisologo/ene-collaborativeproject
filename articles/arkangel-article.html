            <p> The "Arkangel" episode of Black Mirror depicts the concept of helicopter parenting and its potential consequences. Through the application of Gerard Genette's narrative theory, the episode effectively portrays the adverse effects of excessive parental control and surveillance on a child's development. </p>
            <p> In "Arkangel," Marie, a single mother, utilizes the Arkangel technology to closely monitor and censor her daughter Sara's experiences, serving as a metaphor for helicopter parenting. The episode emphasizes the detrimental outcomes of this parenting style, particularly the loss of autonomy, freedom, and privacy experienced by Sara. The narrative structure follows a chronological order, illustrating the gradual impact of Marie's control on Sara's life, restricting her ability to make independent decisions and stifling her individuality. </p>
            <p> The duration and frequency of scenes involving surveillance and Sara's realization of being monitored highlight her emotional struggles and frustrations, effectively conveying the negative psychological effects of helicopter parenting. The repeated instances of monitoring and censorship occur with high frequency, creating an overwhelming sense of constant surveillance, underscoring the suffocating and invasive nature of this parenting approach. </p>
